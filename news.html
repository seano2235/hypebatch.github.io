        <h2>OFF-WHITE LOOKBOOK| Best of all time</h2>
        <h5>Best clothing look book, Nov 14, 2018</h5>

        <p>Many recognize the name Virgil Abloh as Kanye Westâ€™s style consultant, creative director and friend. His first venture in the fashion game may have been PYREX VISION but since Virgil has refined his tastes and is ready to unveil OFF-WHITE. We peeped the full Spring/Summer 2014 lookbook and were impressed with what we saw. Bringing streetwear and fashion together without looking corny is a hard nut to crack but Virgil, a trained architect and engineer, made it possible with his parallel line graphics and perfectly tailored silhouettes. The line is a full cut-and-sew  offering and made in Italy. Keep an eye out for these looks to drop in select retailers soon.</p>
